# Testing Guide - Unified Backend (Current State)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Backend Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** ✅ MongoDB Connected | ✅ JWT Auth Active | ⚠️ Cloudinary Configured (see setup)

---

## 📋 Manual API Testing Guide

Complete testing guide for the unified e-commerce backend API. Use `curl`, Postman, or VS Code REST Client.

### Prerequisites
- Backend running on `http://localhost:5000`
- MongoDB connected and operational
- Cloudinary environment variables configured (optional for image uploads)
- Always include `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN` header for protected routes

---

## 🔐 Authentication Endpoints

### 1. Register New User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123",
    "confirmPassword": "SecurePass123"
  }'
```

**Expected Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "user": {
    "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "role": "USER"
  }
}
```

**Password Requirements:**
- At least 8 characters
- Contains uppercase letter
- Contains lowercase letter
- Contains number

---

### 2. Login User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123"
  }'
```

**Save token for subsequent requests:**
```bash
# PowerShell
$TOKEN = "eyJhbGc..."

# Bash
export TOKEN="eyJhbGc..."

# Then use in headers: -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

### 3. Get Current User Profile

**Using `/me` endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Using `/profile` endpoint (alias):**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "user": {
    "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "role": "USER",
    "isEmailVerified": false,
    "lastLoginAt": "2026-02-25T10:30:00Z",
    "createdAt": "2026-02-25T09:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

---

### 4. Refresh Access Token (Session Persistence)

When your access token expires, use the refresh token (stored in HTTP-only cookie) to get a new one without re-logging in.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/refresh-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "refreshToken=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
```

**Note:** The refresh token is automatically sent in cookies. Frontend handles this automatically via axios interceptor.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Token refreshed successfully",
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..."
}
```

**When to use:** Automatically called by frontend when access token expires (401 status).

---

### 5. Logout (Single Device)

Log out from current device. Other devices remain logged in.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/logout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b "refreshToken=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Logged out successfully"
}
```

**What happens:**
- Refresh token is removed from database
- Refresh token cookie is cleared
- User cannot use refresh token anymore
- Must log in again to access protected routes

---

### 6. Logout All Devices

Log out from all devices at once. All refresh tokens are invalidated.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/logout-all \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Logged out from all devices successfully"
}
```

**What happens:**
- All refresh tokens are deleted from database
- All devices are immediately logged out
- All refresh token cookies are cleared
- Must log in again to access protected routes
- Useful for security when password is compromised

---

## 🔄 Session Management Flow

### Complete Session Lifecycle

1. **User Registration/Login**
   - Access Token generated (short-lived: 7 days)
   - Refresh Token generated (long-lived: 7 days)
   - Access Token → stored in frontend localStorage
   - Refresh Token → stored in HTTP-only cookie automatically

2. **Page Refresh (Before Expiration)**
   - Frontend reads access token from localStorage
   - Access token is still valid, no refresh needed
   - User stays logged in

3. **After Access Token Expires**
   - Admin/protected endpoint returns 401
   - Frontend axios interceptor detects 401
   - Automatically calls `/api/auth/refresh-token`
   - New access token is received
   - Original request is retried with new token

4. **User Logout (Single Device)**
   - Call `POST /api/auth/logout`
   - Refresh token removed from database
   - Frontend clears localStorage and redirects to login
   - Other devices can still use their refresh tokens

5. **User Logout All Devices**
   - Call `POST /api/auth/logout-all`
   - All refresh tokens deleted from database
   - All devices are logged out immediately
   - Everyone must re-login

---

## 🛡️ Security Testing

### CORS Testing
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me \
  -H "Origin: http://different-origin.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -v

# Verify it's in CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in .env
```

### Input Sanitization
```bash
# XSS attempt (should be stored safely)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "<script>alert(\"XSS\");</script>",
    "price": 99.99
  }'

# Stored as literal string - safe
```

### SQL Injection (MongoDB)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@test.com\" OR \"1\"=\"1",
    "password": "anything"
  }'

# Mongoose schema validation prevents injection
```

---

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### Check Backend Logs
```bash
# Terminal where backend is running
# Look for errors in console output
```

### Enable Verbose Curl
```bash
curl -v http://localhost:5000/api/admin/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Shows: Request headers, response headers, status code
```

### Decode JWT Token
```bash
# Online: https://jwt.io
# Or use jq (on Linux/Mac):
echo $TOKEN | cut -d '.' -f 2 | tr '_-' '/+' | fold -w 4 | paste -sd '' | base64 -d | jq
```

### Test MongoDB Connection
```bash
# Backend logs should show:
# ✅ MongoDB Connected: [connection-string]
```

### Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# Check .env file exists in unified-backend folder
cat unified-backend/.env

# Should contain:
# MONGODB_URI=...
# JWT_SECRET=...
# CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
# CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
# CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup Checklist

- [ ] MongoDB connection string in `.env`
- [ ] JWT secret configured in `.env`
- [ ] Admin user seeded (run seedAdminUser.js)
- [ ] Cloudinary credentials in `.env` (optional but recommended)
- [ ] CORS allowed origins configured in `.env`
- [ ] Backend running on port 5000
- [ ] Database indexed properly (fixed duplicate stock index)

---

## 📝 Common Tasks

### Create Test Admin User
```bash
# Run from backend directory
node scripts/seedAdminUser.js
# Credentials: admin@ecommerce.com / AdminPass123
```
